# Flask-Application-Project/For Batsman Selection
Cricket has always been a popular game since its invention in the world. Moreover, it became a religion in India. The selection committees like BCCI,PCB,ACB etc. pick the players based on their previous performances in domestic cricket tournaments like IPL,Ranji Trophy, Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy etc. by committee decisions but there is no application for selection process till now. To develop an application we need player performance analysis and assessment. This project suggests an important approach for Selecting Cricket players by Evaluating his Statistics and Provides a comparative look at machine learning techniques in cricket player selection. In this project a model for Bowlers and Batsmen Separately was proposed which was implemented using Random Forest, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machines(SVM), LightGBM,CatBoost, Logistic Regression Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA), Voting Classifier, Na√Øve Bayes. The findings obtained by the suggested methodology in this project are the same as in the Cricket board selected team players.
